p.1-100000.out: output for all p to 100000 (p-power conductors),
                sorted: 3841 curves

p.1-100000.out.primes: extract from previous, prime conductors only,
                       sorted: 1740 curves

p.db.1-100000: all prime conductor curves for p<100000 from database

   *** the previous two files are identical, showing that the
   algorithm found all the curves it should, or prime conductor <
   100000 ***

2torsionlist.out: Ariel's list of 2-torsion curves for primes to
                  100000 after bug fix
